  "body": "# Manual OTA installation on a potentially modified Google Pixel\r\nThis guide will document how to manually install an OTA update on a rooted (doesn't have to be) Google Pixel while keeping data (including how to re-root / install TWRP after taking the OTA).\r\n\r\n> #### NOTE!\r\n> * This guide assumes you are familiar with command-line terminals and adb / fastboot\r\n> * Text within brackets such as **_[filename]_** are variables to be replaced at your discretion\r\n\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n### Hardware\r\n* Google Pixel needing OTA (can be rooted and/or using TWRP, doesn't matter)\r\n* USB C cable to connect Pixel to Linux / OSX (You can do the same on a Windows machine, but the commands will be slightly different)\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n* Most recent versions of adb & fastboot (get them via [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html))\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n### Collect necessary external files\r\n\r\n#### Android factory images\r\nWe're using the full Android factory image for this method (not the OTA file). Note the differences between Google Pixel \"sailfish\" and Google Pixel XL \"marlin\".\r\n* Download the latest factory image for your device located [here](https://developers.google.com/android/images) *(at the time of this writing, the latest version for the Google Pixel was 7.1.1 (NMF26O, Dec 2016))*\r\n* Extract the ZIP, take note of the file ```flash-all.sh```\r\n\r\n#### SuperSU\r\n* Download the flashable zip [here](https://plus.google.com/+Chainfire/posts/jpR76YEgaM9?sfc=true) *(at the time of this writing, the latest version was SuperSU v2.78 SR5)*\r\n\r\n#### TWRP\r\nDownload the latest version for your Pixel. Make sure to download both the ```[filename].img``` and ```[filename].zip```\r\n* [Google Pixel](https://twrp.me/devices/googlepixel.html)\r\n* [Google Pixel XL](https://twrp.me/devices/googlepixelxl.html)\r\n\r\nCopy the TWRP zip and SuperSU zip to your Pixel.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n### Android factory images\r\n#### Updating the Pixel with the new factory image\r\n* Open ```flash-all.sh``` with a text editor. Note the commands located inside:\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot flash bootloader [bootloader-filename].img\r\nfastboot reboot-bootloader\r\nsleep 5\r\nfastboot flash radio [radio-filename].img\r\nfastboot reboot-bootloader\r\nsleep 5\r\nfastboot -w update [image-filename].zip \r\n```\r\n* You'll be running these commands manually, removing the wipe option ```-w``` from the last command\r\n* Connect Pixel to computer, ensure USB debugging is enabled on the device\r\n* Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder where the extracted Android factory image is.\r\n* Start by rebooting the Pixel into the bootloader\r\n```bash\r\nadb reboot-bootloader\r\n```\r\n* Flash the new bootloader\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot flash bootloader [bootloader-filename].img\r\n```\r\n* Reboot the bootloader\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot reboot-bootloader\r\n```\r\n* Flash the new radio\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot flash radio [radio-filename].img\r\n```\r\n* Reboot the bootloader\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot reboot-bootloader\r\n```\r\n* Flash the new image (remove ```-w``` to keep data)\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot update [image-filename].zip \r\n```\r\n* Once this completes, reboot the Pixel\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot reboot\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, if you had root or TWRP before, it's gone now (expected). You should have a stock Pixel running the image downloaded with all your saved applications etc.\r\n\r\n### TWRP\r\n#### Flashing TWRP (temporarily or permanent)\r\nThere are two installation options. You can 'permanently' install the TWRP alpha over the stock recovery, or just temporarily boot into it to root the Pixel.\r\n\r\n* In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the TWRP ```[filename].img``` exists\r\n* Start by rebooting the Pixel into the bootloader\r\n```bash\r\nadb reboot-bootloader\r\n```\r\n* Temporarily boot TWRP\r\n```bash\r\nfastboot boot [filename].img\r\n```\r\n* Once TWRP is booted, swipe across to allow modifications\r\n* Temporary booting into TWRP is complete, you can proceed to rooting the device now\r\n* **OPTIONAL** - Install the TWRP ```[filename].zip``` on the Pixel via TWRP to permanently replace the stock recovery with TWRP\r\n\r\n### SuperSu\r\n#### Rooting the Pixel\r\nAt this point you should still be in TWRP.\r\n* Install the SuperSU zip on the Pixel via TWRP to grant root access on the device\r\n* Reboot the device\r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\nAnd that's about it. You should have the latest Android factory image installed with root access, all without losing any data or settings. However, any changes made that required root previously (such as build.prop edits) will need to be replicated.",
